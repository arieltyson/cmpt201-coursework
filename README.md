# CMPT 201: Systems Programming Coursework üñ•Ô∏è

## Repository Overview üìö
This repository contains my journey through **CMPT 201: Systems Programming** at Simon Fraser University (Fall 2025). Here you'll find my lab work, practice exercises, and personal explorations into the world of UNIX-like systems programming. Each assignment and lab is organized in its own directory, showcasing my progression from command-line basics to advanced system-level programming concepts.

## Course Focus üéØ
CMPT 201 provides an introduction to UNIX-like application-OS interfaces from a programmer's perspective, covering:
- **Command-Line Mastery:** Linux terminal navigation, shell scripting, and development tools
- **Systems Programming:** Low-level programming in C with direct OS interaction
- **Process Management:** Understanding processes, threads, and concurrent programming
- **Memory Management:** Manual memory allocation, pointers, and system-level memory concepts
- **Inter-Process Communication:** Pipes, sockets, shared memory, and synchronization
- **File Systems:** Storage abstractions and file manipulation at the system level
- **Security Fundamentals:** Basic OS security and cryptographic functions

## Technologies & Tools üíª
This coursework leverages industry-standard systems programming tools:
- **C Programming Language:** For low-level, efficient system programming
- **Linux/UNIX Environment:** Command-line interface and system calls
